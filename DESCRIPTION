Description: Provides estimates for the bivariate and trivariate distribution 
             functions and bivariate and trivariate survival functions for 
             censored gap times. Two approaches, using existing methodologies, 
             are considered: (i) the Lin's estimator, which is based on the 
             extension the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the distribution function 
             for the first event time and the Inverse Probability of Censoring 
             Weights for the second time (Lin DY, Sun W, Ying Z (1999) 
             <doi:10.1093/biomet/86.1.59> and (ii) another estimator
             based on Kaplan-Meier weights (Una-Alvarez J, Meira-Machado L (2008)
             <https://w3.math.uminho.pt/~lmachado/Biometria_conference.pdf>). 
             The proposed methods are the landmark estimators based on 
             subsampling approach, and the estimator based on weighted cumulative
             hazard estimator. The package also provides nonparametric estimator
             conditional to a given continuous covariate. All these methods have
             been submitted to be published.
